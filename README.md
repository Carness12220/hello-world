This repository is for getting started with GitHub and practicing its flow


I am a woman nearing midlife who has found herself in need of a career change. I chose computers because, from a young age, I have always been drawn to them. I truly feel like computers are me, and I am a computer. I am transported to a whole new world when I sit at one, and I can get lost for hours, and I LOVE IT! I love learning! Computers provide so much of it to me, though I have to admit that I feel lost at times.
