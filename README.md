print("Hello World")

I am a woman nearing midlife who has found herself in need of a career change. I chose computers because, from a young age, I always felt drawn to them. I truly feel like computers are me, and I am a computer. I am transported to a whole new world when I am sitting at one, and I can get lost for hours, and I LOVE IT! I love learning! Computers provide so much of it to me, though I have to admit that at times, I feel lost.
